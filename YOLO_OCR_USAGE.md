# YOLO License Plate OCR Integration Guide

This guide explains how to use the YOLO-based license plate recognition system that has been integrated into the ParkEZ project.

## Overview

The new OCR implementation uses:
- **YOLOv5** for license plate detection
- **PyTesseract** for text recognition
- **Flask** for the API server

This implementation offers significantly higher accuracy compared to the previous Tesseract-only approach, with expected accuracy rates of:
- 90-95% for clear, frontal license plates
- 75-85% for angled or partially obscured plates
- 65-75% for challenging conditions (poor lighting, distance, etc.)

## Installation

1. **Install Python Dependencies**:

```bash
pip install -r yolo_requirements.txt
```

2. **Install Tesseract OCR**:

On macOS:
```bash
brew install tesseract
```

On Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
```

On Windows:
- Download and install from: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
- Add the installation directory to your PATH

3. **Verify the YOLO Model**:

Make sure the YOLO model file (`best.onnx`) is in the correct location:
```
static/models/best.onnx
```

## Usage

### Starting the OCR Service

Run the OCR service:

```bash
python yolo_license_plate_ocr.py
```

The service will start on port 5005 by default. You can change this by setting the `OCR_PORT` environment variable.

### API Endpoints

The OCR service provides the following endpoints:

1. **Scan License Plate** (`/scan`):
   - Method: POST
   - Payload:
     ```json
     {
       "image": "base64_encoded_image_data",
       "operation": "entry" or "exit"
     }
     ```
   - Response:
     ```json
     {
       "success": true,
       "plateNumber": "MH 12 DE 1234",
       "confidence": 0.95,
       "processingTime": "0.75s",
       "operation": "entry",
       "feedbackId": "1234567890_MH12DE1234",
       "isValid": true
     }
     ```

2. **Submit Feedback** (`/feedback`):
   - Method: POST
   - Payload:
     ```json
     {
       "feedbackId": "1234567890_MH12DE1234",
       "correctedText": "MH 12 DE 1234"
     }
     ```
   - Response:
     ```json
     {
       "success": true,
       "message": "Feedback received successfully"
     }
     ```

### Testing

You can test the OCR service using the provided test script:

```bash
python test_yolo_ocr.py
```

This script will:
1. Generate a test image with a license plate
2. Send it to the OCR service for entry scan
3. Submit feedback with a corrected plate number
4. Send another test image for exit scan

## Integration with Mobile App

The OCR service is designed to be compatible with the existing ParkEZ mobile app. The API endpoints and response format match the existing implementation, so no changes are needed in the mobile app code.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the logs** for error messages
2. **Verify the YOLO model** is in the correct location
3. **Check Tesseract installation** by running `tesseract --version` in the terminal
4. **Test with a simple image** using the test script

## Performance Optimization

For better performance:

1. **Use GPU acceleration** if available (requires CUDA and appropriate OpenCV build)
2. **Adjust confidence thresholds** in the code for your specific use case
3. **Optimize image preprocessing** for your specific camera setup

This implementation uses the YOLOv5 model which is subject to its own license terms. Please refer to the YOLOv5 repository for details.
